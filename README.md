# TODO-cli

This repo contains the TODO CLI I use on a daily basis to manage tasks.
The functionality is currently limited to the following:

- Add, list, update & delete TODO:s
- Sync todo:s using git

## Future development

- LLM support to ease task creation
- Some clever way to integrate with mobile devices
- Auto sync

## Installation

Using pypi: Not yet supported

Requires python to be installed (developed using Python 3.11)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErikLundin98/todo-cli
cd todo-cli
make install_cli
```
